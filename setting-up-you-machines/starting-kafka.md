# Starting Kafka

At this point, Kafka has already been installed and all we have to do is start the service.

### Step 1

Let first start the Zookeeper service. In a new terminal \(Window &gt; New terminal or `Alt-T`\) run the following script.

```text
./scripts/zookeeper-start.sh
```

### Step 2

Next, let's start the Kafka service. In a new terminal \(Window &gt; New terminal or `Alt-T`\) run the following script.

```text
./scripts/kafka-start.sh
```

> Tip: You can stop the services using the following commands:

> ```text
> ./scripts/kafka-stop.sh
> ```

> ```text
> ./scripts/zookeeper-stop.sh
> ```
